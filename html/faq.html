        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <div class="faq_body_container">
        <h2>Q: Do I need a microphone to participate?</h2>
        <p>
            A: Nope! As a pilot, you only need to be able to listen to instructions
            from ATC, you can use text for readbacks and requests.
        </p>
        <h2>Q: I used to be a controller in the old server. Can I have my rank back?</h2>
        <p>
            A: We recommend remedial training for returning controllers as quite a 
            few things have changed, but we will rerank you as long as a staff member or 
            current controller can vouch for you, or you provide proof through a screenshot or similar.
        </p>
        <h2>Q: How do I become a controller?</h2>
        <p>
            A: Use the open-a-ticket channel in the discord to open a training request. After answering a quick questionaire our insructors
            should be right with you to begin ATC training.
        </p>
        <h2>Q: Where can I find the charts?</h2>
        <p>A: You can acess the charts from right here using the "Charts" link in the top right.</p>
        <h2>Q: How do I know if an airport is controlled?</h2>
        <p>
            A: First, you should look for a ground, tower, or approach/departure/radar controller for that airport.
            Their frequency name will always have the ICAO code of the airport (ex. EGAI, KCIA, VHAL).
            If there are none of those for the airport, look for the center/control (CTR) controller whose airspace covers that airport
            (see the enroute chart for center boundaries). If AEROCONTROL (AERO_CTR) is online, they control everything!
        </p>
        <h2>Q: Can I just listen in to ATC without flying?</h2>
        <p>
            Of course! We actually encourage observing a bit before flying to get an idea of what to do.
            We only ask that if the server is very full to not sit in-game doing nothing as someone else
            could be flying in your place.
        </p>
        <h2>Q: Why don't the in-game waypoints and enroute chart line up?</h2>
        <p>
            A: The in-game waypoints are based off an older version of the enroute chart and thus some waypoints either don't line up
            or are missing entirely. It can also be very difficult to perfectly line everything up, so some waypoints might be a bit off.
        </p>
        <h2>Q: Where can I ask any other questions I have?</h2>
        <p>Use the community-support channel to ask any other questions you might have. We will be happy to answer!</p>
